# Profile Web Page

## Goals
I need a web page with a basic profile. Feel free to explore a range of options or a single design.

## Standards
- Add your own profile example/examples in a separate folder.
- Rename the file as *your_username.html*
- Create your own versions of the profile web page and add it in a new folder.

## Getting Started

  ```

* Make your changes
* Commit and Push

  ```sh
